 * that drives layout selection.
 *
 * CORS is NOT enabled here on purpose: the Astro app fetches WordPress

 * the browser same-origin/CORS restriction never applies to this traffic.
 * Only add CORS headers if a future feature calls the WP REST API directly
 * from client-side JS.
 *
 * Also fires a revalidation webhook on publish/update/trash (below) so the
 * frontend's in-memory cache (src/lib/wp.ts) is purged immediately instead
 * of waiting out its TTL fallback — see astro_trigger_revalidate().
